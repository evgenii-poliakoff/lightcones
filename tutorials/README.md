# spin_boson_model.ipynb

In this notebook we consider the model of open quantum system, on the example of spin-boson model.
We discuss how the initial value problem is posed for the nonstationary dynamics of local quantum quench.
We also provide an example of a numerically exact (i.e. converged with respect to truncation parameters)
computation of observable averages via solution of the non-stationary Schrodinger equation in the tructated Fock space.
