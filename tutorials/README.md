In this notebook we consider the model of open quantum system, on the example of spin-boson model.
We discuss how the initial value problem is posed for the nonstationary dynamics of local quantum quench.
We also provide an example of a numerically exact (i.e. converged with respect to truncation parameters)
computation of observable averages via solution of the non-stationary Schrodinger equation in the truncated Fock space.

# star2chain.ipynb

Here we introduce the two standard forms of the open quantum system model: the star and the chain representations, and how to switch between them

# operator_spread.ipynb

In the interacting picture (with respect to the free bath), the coupling operator will spread along the chain during the quench. The coefficients of the spread $\alpha_k\left(t\right)$ play important role in our approach

# wavepackets_decoupling.ipynb

Here we demonstrate why the real-time local quench problem is a complicated many-body problem: there is no backward front in the spatial picture. The emitted quanta decouple very slowly (the commutators decay in an algebraic way). We have long-range interaction in the time domain.

# light_cone_interior_normal_modes.ipynb

Here we discuss the retarded light cone density matrix, the light cone interior normal modes, and their asymptotic properties.

# fidelity_relevant_subspace.ipynb

Here we demonstrate the convergence properties of the fidelity of the full open system-bath wavefunction converges with respect to the number of kept light cone interior normal modes.

# arrival_times.ipynb

The concept of arrival times (inside the light cone interior) for degress of freedom is illustrated. A sequence of arrival times is defined for arbitrary frame. Different frames have different rates at which the modes arrive. In the star representations all the modes arrive (alomost) instantly at $t=0$. Whereas in the chain representations the modes arrive gradually (the light cone is well defined).

# minimal_lighcone.ipynb

There is a frame such that the rate at which the modes arrive is minimal. (Roughly speaking, a frame in which the Lieb-Robinson velocity is minimal). A numerical procedure to construct such a frame is presented.
