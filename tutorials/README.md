# spin_boson_model.ipynb

In this notebook we consider the model of open quantum system, on the example of spin-boson model.
We discuss how the initial value problem is posed for the nonstationary dynamics of local quantum quench.
We also provide an example of a numerically exact (i.e. converged with respect to truncation parameters)
computation of observable averages via solution of the non-stationary Schrodinger equation in the truncated Fock space.

# star2chain.ipynb

Here we introduce the two standard forms of the open quantum system model: the star and the chain representations, and how to switch between them

# operator_spread.ipynb

In the interacting picture (with respect to the free bath), the coupling operator will spread along the chain during the quench. The coefficients of the spread $\alpha_k\left(t\right)$ play important role in our approach

# wavepackets_decoupling.ipynb

Here we demonstrate why the real-time local quench problem is a complicated many-body problem: there is no backward front in the spatial picture. The emitted quanta decouple very slowly (the commutators decay in an algebraic way). We have long-range interaction in the time domain.

# light_cone_interior_normal_modes.ipynb

Here we discuss the retarded light cone density matrix, the light cone interior normal modes, and their asymptotic properties.
